# Face-Emotion-Recognition
This project focuses on real-time facial emotion recognition, detecting and classifying emotions directly from facial expressions. The model identifies emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and more, leveraging a dataset of facial images and using both traditional computer vision techniques and deep learning approaches.
